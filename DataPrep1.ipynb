    "## Source Data\n",
    "The source of baseball data for this lab is the Sean Lahman Baseball Database [ http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/]. Often cited as the most complete baseball database, the data set includes twenty-seven data tables and millions of records covering most non-proprietary baseball data pertaining to offense, fielding, pitching, payroll, player demographics, team statistics, manager data and much more. In past assignments, this team has focused on team level data.  For this Lab, the team will focus on player level data.  In particular, the focus will be on position players.  Pitchers will not be viewed in this study.  This will allow for more exploration of baseball data and provide a broader variety of regression and classification scenarios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will focus on the analysis of four specific tables containing player level details in the Lahman Baseball Database:  Batting, Fielding, Player Awards and Salaries.  The names of the different tables accurately describe the contents.  For example, the Batting table contains offensive statics per year for each player.  The tables are at different grains.  The utlimate intention is to have a single dataframe accurately combining all relevant features of the four tables.  The methods used to achieve this goal will be presented below.  To begin, a simple SQL query was written to join the four tables together.  This is a task efficiently handled by any database with few lines of code when compared to the code needed for the same operation in python.  The SQL is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT Batting.*, AwardsPlayers.*, Fielding.*, Salaries.*\n",
    "FROM ((Batting LEFT JOIN AwardsPlayers ON (Batting.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID) AND (Batting.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID)) LEFT JOIN Fielding ON (Batting.stint = Fielding.stint) AND (Batting.yearID = Fielding.yearID) AND (Batting.playerID = Fielding.playerID)) LEFT JOIN Salaries ON (Batting.yearID = Salaries.yearID) AND (Batting.playerID = Salaries.playerID);\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining filtering, feature reduction and subsetting tasks will be performed in Python.  \n"
